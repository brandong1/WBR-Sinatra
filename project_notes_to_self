PUT vs. PATCH

PUT /users/1
{
    "username": "skwee357",
    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address
}

//You can accomplish the same using PATCH. That might look like this:

PATCH /users/1
{
    "email": "skwee357@gmail.com"       // new email address
}
Y
//You'll notice a difference right away between these two. The PUT included all of the parameters on this user, but PATCH only included the one that was being modified (email).
